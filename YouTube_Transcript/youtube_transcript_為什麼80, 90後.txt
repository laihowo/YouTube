為什麼80, 90後對工作缺乏熱情？► 因為老闆少做了這件事 - Simon Sinek（中英字幕）

i'll tell you a true story a few months
ago i stayed at the
four seasons in las vegas
it is a wonderful hotel
and the reason it's a wonderful hotel is
not because of the fancy beds any hotel
can go and buy a fancy bed the reason
it's a wonderful hotel is because of the
people who work there if you walk past
somebody at the four seasons and this
and they say hello to you you get the
feeling that they actually wanted to say
hello to you it's not that somebody told
them that you have to say hello to all
the customers say hello to all the
guests right you actually feel that they
care
now in their lobby they have
a coffee stand and i one afternoon i
went to buy a cup of coffee and there
was a barista by the name of noah who
was serving me noah was fantastic he was
friendly and fun
and he was engaging with me and i had so
much fun buying a cup of coffee i
actually think i gave 100 tip right he
was wonderful so as is my nature i asked
noah
do you like your job and without
skipping a beat noah says
i love my job
and so i followed up i said what is it
that the four seasons is doing
that would make you say to me
i love my job and without skipping a
beat
noah said throughout the day managers
will walk past me and ask me how i'm
doing if there's anything that i need to
do my job better he said not just my
manager
any manager
and then he said something magical
he says
i also work at caesar's palace
and caesar at caesar's palace the
managers are trying to make sure we're
doing everything right they catch us
when we do things wrong
he says when i go to work there i like
to keep my head under the radar and just
get through the day so i can get my
paycheck
he says here at the four seasons i feel
i can be
myself
same person
entirely a different experience from the
from the customer who will engage with
noah
if we create the right environment we
will get people like noah at the four
seasons if we create the wrong
environment we will get people like noah
at caesar's palace
do you know the quickest way to destroy
trust and destroy cooperation in a
business literally in one day
lay people off and everyone gets scared
and forget about the people who lost
their job think about the people who
kept their jobs because every single
decision a company makes is a piece of
communication and the company the
company has just communicated to
everybody else this is not a meritocracy
we don't care how hard you work or how
long you've worked here if we miss our
numbers and you happen to fall on the
wrong side of the spreadsheet i'm sorry
we cannot guarantee employment in other
words we come to work every day
afraid
and we're asking our youngest generation
to work in environments where how would
any of us ever stand up and admit i made
a mistake
we're constantly being told you have to
be vulnerable leaders are vulnerable
what does that even mean it doesn't mean
you walk around crying i'm vulnerable
right
no what vulnerability means is you
create an environment in which someone
feels safe enough to raise their hand
and say
i don't know what i'm doing
you've given me a job and i haven't been
trained to do it i need help i made a
mistake i screwed something up
i'm scared i'm worried
all of these things no one would ever
admit inside a company because it puts a
target on your head in case there's
another round and so we keep it to
ourselves and how can a company ever do
well if nobody's ever willing to admit
they made a mistake that's scared or
they don't know what they're doing and
so we've literally created cultures in
which every single day everybody comes
to work and hype lies hides and fakes
and we're asking our youngest generation
to work and succeed and find themselves
and build their confidence and overcome
their addiction to technology and build
strong relationships at work we're
asking to do this and these the
environments we've created
we keep saying to them you're the future
leaders we're the leaders now
[Music]
we're in control
what are we doing
this is what empathy means
it means if there's an entire generation
struggling
maybe it's not them
it's like you know the only thing that i
that
the common factor in all my failed
relationships
me
same thing well we just can't get the
right you know the right performance out
of our people maybe it's you
right it's not a generation
it's not them they're not difficult or
hard to understand
they're human beings like the rest of us
trying to find their way trying to work
in a place where they feel that someone
cares about them as a human being by the
way
that's what we all want
in other words it's not even
generational
it's all of us
this is the practice of empathy that if
we're struggling to communicate to
someone if it's struggling to help
someone be at their natural best i'm
tired of people saying to me how do i
get the best out of my people really
that's what you want they're like a
towel you just ring them how can i get
the most out of them
no how do i help my people be at their
natural best
here's the lack of empathy this is
normal in our business world you walk
into someone's office someone walks into
our office and says your numbers have
been down for the third quarter in a row
you have to pick up your numbers
otherwise i can't guarantee what the
future will look like how inspired you
think that person is to come to work the
next day
here's what empathy looks like you walk
into someone's office someone walks into
your office and says your numbers are
down for the third quarter in a row
are you okay
i'm worried about you
what's going on
we all have performance issues maybe
someone's kid is sick maybe they're
having problems in their marriage maybe
one of their parents is dying we don't
know what's going on in their lives and
of course it will affect performance at
work empathy is being concerned about
the human being not just their output
we have to start by practicing empathy
and relate to what they may be going
through and it will profoundly change
the decisions we make it will profoundly
change
the way we see the world
