# YouTube
This is my project of YouTube.

I have learnt how to create and deploy a custom robot on Poe.com recently. It can summarise the YouTube video transcript from the URL inputted by users. The large language model (LLM) cannot read the transcript from the URL directly so that I have to write the Python bot server program to process the URL by libraries of web scraping and translator. After that, it will output the prompt and full transcript to feed the LLM. At last, the robot can response to users' query with the video content summary and key points.
